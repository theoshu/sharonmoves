Pilates is a safe, challenging workout for the body and the mind, allowing you to get in shape — and stay there — at any age. No other training is so gentle on the body while also providing an intense workout.

Conventional workouts often build short, bulky muscles, which can be prone to injury, but pilates elongates and strengthens, improving both muscle elasticity and joint mobility. Pilates also helps you develop a strong core. Your “core” is made up of deep abdominal muscles and muscles closest to the spine, so building your core improves overall strength and posture.

The experienced pilates instructors at Sharon Moves will modify the traditional pilates exercises to your needs, allowing for a range of difficulty from beginner to advanced. That means you’ll get the workout that’s best for you now and increase the intensity as your conditioning improves.
