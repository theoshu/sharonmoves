Sharon Stinson is a dedicated fitness instructor in Houston with 12+ years of experience in pilates, gyrotonic, suspension, and personal training. Her passion is leading clients to a balanced life via pilates, cardio, and strength training.

Sharon hasn’t always been a fitness queen. As a young adult, she found herself more than 100 pounds overweight thanks to poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. Health issues led her to make a lifelong change, improving her diet and adding exercise to lose weight permanently.

Now Sharon is passionate about exercise and movement — so passionate that her clients affectionately refer to her as the Perky Ass-Kicker. Outside of training and instruction, you’ll find Sharon still moving: Dancing, playing, and biking all over Houston. She feels lucky to help people make healthy choices and change the way they live, and she’d love to help you.

Contact Sharon Moves now with questions or to schedule a session at her pilates studio.
